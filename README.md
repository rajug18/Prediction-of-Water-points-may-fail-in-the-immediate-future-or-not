# Prediction of Water points may fail  in the immediate future or not

Water is the ultimate gift of nature to humanity and every living organism. Most of us have the luxury to 
lead our daily lives without feeling blunt of water scarcity but there are people in some parts of the 
world where they would have to walk several miles to have access to water.  The situation worsens for 
them if this access, such as pumps, wells, or other water-points, also shuts down unexpectedly.

# Objective

To predict which water point may fail in the immediate future, they 
can divert the maintenance resource towards that point with reasonable advance notice.
